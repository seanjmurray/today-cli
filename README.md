## Goal

I wanted to build a simple CLI tool to track events, tasks, and notes. You can enter daily tasks to to keep track of, notes to remember and events to not forget about. I am trying to create an almost bullet journal like tool but keep the ui clean and simple. Feel free to reach out to me with any suggestions or open a pull request.
